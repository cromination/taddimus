# Taddimus.com WordPress Website
 
This is a landoized version of Taddimus.com that is composer managed distribution for WordPress.

## Services

The site is using the following services:
- Apache webserver
- PHP 8.1
- MySql 8.0
- Composer 2.3

### Local file backups

Locally there are a few files that are backed up in .backups at gitroot including the local wp-config.php and .htaccess.  This is due to the WordPress distribution chosen in composer overwriting these files when it updates between versions.

    > These are not in version control and will be addressed in future updates to this site.
