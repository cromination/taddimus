#####   Version 4.6.1 (2022-05-27)

 - Bugfix: Added missing selector in `backend.js`
 - Improvement: Updating the FAQ about properly using this plugin with WP Rocket - added hyperlinked to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/isaumya/d5990b036e0ed2ac55631995f862f4b8)

 - Update compatibility with WordPress 6.0

####   Version 4.6.0 (2022-05-20)

- Bugfix: Removing the trailing slash from the `swcfpc_fallback_cache_remove_url_parameters()` when query parameters are removed from the URL. Previously it was creating double cache keys when the same URL is visited once without any query param and then with e.g. utm query param.
- Improvement: Added `swcfpc_fc_modify_current_url` filter for special use cases where the user wants to filter the `$current_uri` by themselves and remove the query params as they see fit.
- Improvement: Updating the worker code to ensure that static files are not processed by Worker and instead let the CF system handle the static file in accordance with the cache-control header. Also replaced the forEach() and every() loop with a much faster for() loop to improve the code performance, vastly reducing CPU usage.
- Bugfix: Make sure that the preloader runs only after all cache purging is complete
- Bugfix: Make sure that the purge_cache_on_post_edit() and wp_rocket_hooks() does not fire when nav menus are updated from the WP Nav Menu page

* Improve admin area loading scripts, making sure that on the backend the plugin scripts are not loaded where it is not needed for example customizer pages, oxygen visual page builder pages etc.
* Added a much more robust and updated version of the Worker Script which does the same thing as previously but now is more robust with multiple exception handling across every possible edge case and to ensure the worker script never throws an unhandled exception no matter what is thrown at it. Also now when a page cache is bypassed due to the default bypass cookie, in the response header under the x-wp-cf-super-cache-worker-bypass-reason it will show you the name of the default cookie for which the cache has been bypassed.
* Improve worker update by making sure when someone updates the plugin, the worker script is also gets updated.
