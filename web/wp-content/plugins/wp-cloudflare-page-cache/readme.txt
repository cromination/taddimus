Supercharge Your Pagespeed and SEO by Powerful Caching, JS/CSS, Media, and Cloudflare's Global CDN.

== Description ==

### **Why Choose This Plugin?**

The Super Page Cache plugin helps you to make your website blazing fast by taking the website caching to the next level. This plugin will help you to cache not only the static files (e.g. CSS, JS, images etc.) but also the HTML webpages generated by WordPress; both at server disk-level and to the global Cloudflare CDN.

Moreover, **this plugin works completely out of the box**, you can use it without or with Cloudlflare, if you want to use the Cloudflare CDN, all you need to do is provide your Cloudflare Account's API Key or API Token details and the plugin will do the rest. But if you are a curious/advanced user, there are detailed settings inside the plugin which you can tweak to make it work as you like. But for most users, you don't need to change any settings as this plugin will work perfectly with the default settings, out of the box.

Unlike most caching plugin out there which only provides disk caching (i.e. the cached webpages will be served from your web-server), this plugin will cache your webpages and static files to the Cloudflare CDN, one of the [fastest CDN networks](https://www.cdnperf.com/cdn-compare?type=performance&location=world&cdn=akamai-cdn,aws-cloudfront-cdn,azure-cdn,bunnycdn,cachefly,cdn-net,cdn77,cdnetworks,cloudflare-cdn,dorabase,fastly-cdn,g-core-labs-cdn,google-cloud-cdn,keycdn,nusec-cdn,ovh-cdn,stackpath-cdn,verizon-edgecast-cdn) in the world.

With [more than 200 CDN edge locations](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/) provided by Cloudflare, your webpage will be served from the nearest CDN location of the visitor, rather than sending the request to your web server which might be sitting on the other side of the world. This will reduce your website loading speed drastically thanks to taking advantage of the Cloudflare CDN, not only for the static files but also for the HTML webpages. Take a look at the review video below by IdeaSpot, which will give you a clear idea about the plugin before you install it.

### **How does the plugin work?**

This plugin takes full advantage of the *FREE Cloudflare Plan*, so to use this plugin, you don't need a paid Cloudflare account. But if you like to use features like Cloudflare image optimization, WAF (Web Application Firewall) etc. then you have to pay for the Cloudflare Pro plan to enable those features in your Cloudflare account.

The free Cloudflare plan allows you to enable a page cache by entering the *Cache Everything* page rule, greatly improving response times. However for dynamic websites such as Wordpress, it is not possible to use this page rule without running into problems as it is not possible to exclude critical web pages from the cache, the sessions for logged in users, ajax requests and much more. **Thanks to this plugin all of this becomes possible.**

This plugin enable page caching on your website by taking advantage of either the Cloudflare *Cache Everything* page rule or using Cloudflare Worker. By default the Cloudflare Worker mode is disabled as it is [not 100% free](https://workers.cloudflare.com/#plans) like the *Cache Everything* page rule. But you can enable it if you like.

The Cloudflare Worker based solution will help you to have a clean page caching solution without any cache buster query string (/?swcfpc=1) for logged-in users. Moreover, you can also overwrite our default worker code to add your own custom login into it if you are an advanced user.

You will be able to significantly **improve the response times of your Wordpress website** by taking advantage of the very fast Cloudflare cache also for HTML pages, **saving a lot of bandwidth**. The alternative to this plugin is to purchase and configure the Enterprise plan.

Not just these, we are constantly working towards adding new useful features to the plugin all the time. So, your love and support is what keep us going. If you love using the plugin, please consider **sharing your review** in the [review section](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-cloudflare-page-cache/#reviews).

### **Important Notice**

If you are using this plugin in conjunction with other page caching plugins like WP Rocket, [LiteSpeed Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/litespeed-cache/), W3 Total Cache etc. please ensure that the page caching feature is disabled on those plugins, as the page caching will be handled by this plugin only.

You can also use plugins like [Autoptimize](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/), Perfmatters, ShortPixel, WP Rocket or Optimole to optimize your static assets while using this plugin for page caching.

If you are an advanced user/developer, you will be pleased to know that **this plugin is 100% jQuery free and compatible with all versions of Wordpress and all Wordpress themes.**

If you are using Kinsta as your hosting provider, this plugin works flawlessly with Kinsta's Server Level Caching and this plugin has also been thoroughly tested on Kinsta Servers to ensure it is fully compatible with Kinsta Server Caching.

Moreover if you are using any hosting platform for whom we support their native server caching (i.e. Kinsta, WP Engine, SpinupWP etc.) you don't have to enable our fallback cache system, as you can use the native disk cache provided by your host instead of using our disk level fallback cache.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How this plugin is different from Cloudflare APO? =

Cloudflare have launched Automatic Platform Optimization (APO) feature in 2020 which works with the default Cloudflare WordPress plugin. APO works by taking advantage of Cloudflare Workers & KV Storage. As APO uses KV to store the cached content, one of the feature it has is that when something is cached via APO, it instantly get pushed to all the Cloudflare edges around the world, even though no requests has came from that region.

Our plugin is created to ensure even the Cloudflare FREE account users can take full advantage of Cloudflare CDN caching, so we provide both option (page rule based - which is the default mode) and the Worker based. Now Cloudflare Worker is not 100% free like the page rules so for very high traffic site, users might need to pay to use the Cloudflare Workers.

That being said, CF APO costs 5$/month for free account holders and it is free for paid account users. But still it lacks many features, functionality and third-party plugin integration compared to our plugin. The feature and integration provided by our plugin is simply unmatched by APO. Currently we can't push the cache everywhere like APO but we are planning to do something similar in near future. If you are still curious, [read this thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/automatic-platform-optimization-for-wordpress/#post-13486593) where you will find a detailed comparison with Cloudflare APO vs this plugin.

= How do I know if everything is working properly? =

To verify that everything is working properly, I invite you to check the HTTP response headers of the displayed page in Incognito mode (browse in private). Super Page Cache returns two headers:

**x-wp-cf-super-cache**

If its value is **cache**, Super Page Cache is active on the displayed page and the page cache is enabled. If **no-cache**, Super Page Cache is active but the page cache is disabled for the displayed page.

**x-wp-cf-super-cache-active**

This header is present only if the previous header has the value **cache**.

If its value is **1**, the displayed page should have been placed in the Cloudflare cache.

To find out if the page is returned from the cache, Cloudflare sets its header called **cf-cache-status**.

If its value is **HIT**, the page has been returned from cache.

If **MISS**, the page was not found in cache. Refresh the page.

If **BYPASS**, the page was excluded from Super Page Cache for Cloudflare.

If **EXPIRED**, the page was cached but the cache has expired.

= Do you allow to bypass the cache for logged in users even on free plan? =

Yes. This is the main purpose of this plugin.

= What is the swcfpc query variabile I see to every internal links when I'm logged in? =

It is a cache buster. Allows you, while logged in, to bypass the Cloudflare cache for pages that could be cached.

= Do you automatically clean up the cache on website changes? =

Yes, you can enable this option from the settings page.

= Can I restore all Cloudflare settings as before the plugin activation? =

Yes, there is a reset button.

= What happens if I delete the plugin? =

I advise you to disable the plugin before deleting it, to allow you to restore all the information on Cloudflare. Then you can proceed with the elimination. This plugin will delete all the data stored into the database so that your Wordpress installation remains clean.

= What happens to the browser caching settings on Cloudflare? =

You will not be able to use them anymore. However, there is an option to enable browser caching rules

= Does it work with multisite? =

Yes but it must be installed separately for each website in the network as each site requires an ad-hoc configuration and may also be part of different Cloudflare accounts.

= Can I use this plugin together with other performance plugins such like Autoptimize, WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache? =

Yes, you can. Read the FAQ section in the plugin settings page for further information

= I have more questions or Something is not working, what can I do? =

First check the questions mentioned in the FAQ tab inside the plugin settings page, as you will find most of the questions already answered there. If that still doesn't help, Enable the log mode and send us the log file and the steps to reproduce the issue. Make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin.
