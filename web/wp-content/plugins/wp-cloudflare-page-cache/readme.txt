Boost PageSpeed, SEO, and Core Web Vitals with full page caching, JS/CSS optimization, media optimization, and Cloudflare CDN.

== Description ==

Super Page Cache is a powerful full page cache plugin for WordPress that caches static files (CSS, JS, images) and HTML webpages at both server disk-level and the global Cloudflare CDN. Get enterprise-level performance with zero configuration required.

Works right out of the box with or without Cloudflare. Powerful disk caching saves files locally on your server. To use Cloudflare CDN, just enter your API Key or Token. The intuitive dashboard includes detailed settings and built-in documentation, though most users won't need to change the defaults.

### **🚀 How Does The Plugin Work?**

**Disk Caching (Works Without Cloudflare):** Server-level caching saves HTML pages and static files directly to your server, loading pages instantly without any CDN.

**Cloudflare CDN (Optional):** Connect your Cloudflare account to leverage **[200+ edge locations](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/)** using modern Cache Rules. Works with **FREE Cloudflare Plan** - no paid account required. Achieve higher Pingdom and GTmetrix scores with edge delivery.

Supports **Free, Pro, and Enterprise** Cloudflare plans with auto-purging, cron jobs, and integrated metrics.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin different from Cloudflare APO? =

Cloudflare APO uses Workers & KV Storage to push cache to all edges instantly. It costs $5/month for free accounts (free for paid accounts).

Our plugin enables FREE account users to leverage **Cloudflare's Cache Rules** with more features, functionality, and third-party plugin integration than APO offers. [Read a detailed comparison](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/automatic-platform-optimization-for-wordpress/#post-13486593).

= How do I know if everything is working properly? =

Check HTTP response headers in Incognito mode:

- **x-wp-cf-super-cache**: `cache` = active, `no-cache` = disabled for this page
- **x-wp-cf-super-cache-active**: `1` = page placed in Cloudflare cache
- **cf-cache-status**: `HIT` = served from cache, `MISS` = refresh page, `BYPASS` = excluded, `EXPIRED` = cache expired

= Do you allow to bypass the cache for logged in users even on free plan? =

Yes. This is the main purpose of this plugin.

= What is the swcfpc query variable I see on every internal link when I'm logged in? =

It is a cache buster. Allows you, while logged in, to bypass the Cloudflare cache for pages that could be cached.

= Do you automatically clean up the cache on website changes? =

Yes, you can enable this option from the settings page.

= Can I restore all Cloudflare settings as before the plugin activation? =

Yes, there is a reset button.

= What happens if I delete the plugin? =

Disable the plugin first to restore Cloudflare settings, then delete. The plugin removes all stored data to keep your WordPress installation clean.

= What happens to the browser caching settings on Cloudflare? =

You will not be able to use them anymore. However, there is an option to enable browser caching rules.

= Does it work with multisite? =

Yes but it must be installed separately for each website in the network as each site requires an ad-hoc configuration and may also be part of different Cloudflare accounts.

= Can I use this plugin together with other performance plugins such as Autoptimize, WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache? =

Yes, you can. Read the FAQ section in the plugin settings page for further information

= I have more questions or something is not working, what can I do? =

Check the FAQ tab in plugin settings first. If needed, enable log mode and send us the log file with steps to reproduce. Ensure you're using the latest version.
