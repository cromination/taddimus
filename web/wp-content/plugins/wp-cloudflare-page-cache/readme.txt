Supercharge Your Pagespeed and SEO by Powerful Caching, JS/CSS, Media, and Cloudflare's Global CDN.

== Description ==

Super Page Cache takes your website caching to the next level, making your WordPress site blazing fast by caching not only static files (CSS, JS, images) but also HTML webpages, both at server disk-level and to the global Cloudflare CDN. With our completely redesigned dashboard and advanced optimization features, you get enterprise-level performance with zero configuration required.

This plugin works right out of the box. You can use it with or without Cloudflare. It offers powerful disk caching by saving files locally on your server, even without using a CDN. If you want to take advantage of the Cloudflare CDN, just enter your Cloudflare API Key or API Token, and the plugin will handle the rest. For advanced users, the intuitive dashboard features detailed settings and built-in documentation. Most users don‚Äôt need to make any changes because it runs smoothly with the default settings.

### **üöÄ How Does The Plugin Work?**

Super Page Cache provides blazing-fast performance through dual caching layers: intelligent disk caching that works completely standalone, plus optional Cloudflare CDN integration for global edge caching.

#### Disk Caching (Works Without Cloudflare)
The plugin provides powerful server-level disk caching by saving cached HTML pages and static files directly to your server. This works completely independently and delivers significant speed improvements even without any CDN integration. Your pages load instantly from locally cached files, dramatically reducing server processing time.

#### Optional Cloudflare CDN Integration
When you connect your Cloudflare account, the plugin leverages **Cloudflare's modern Cache Rules** (replacing outdated page rules and worker methods) to intelligently cache your content across Cloudflare's global network. This takes full advantage of the **FREE Cloudflare Plan** - no paid account required.

#### Why This Matters for Your Website Speed
Unlike most caching plugins that only provide disk caching (serving cached webpages from your web server), Super Page Cache caches your webpages and static files in the **Cloudflare CDN, one of the world's [fastest CDN networks](https://www.cdnperf.com/cdn-compare?type=performance&location=world&cdn=akamai-cdn,aws-cloudfront-cdn,azure-cdn,bunnycdn,cachefly,cdn-net,cdn77,cdnetworks,cloudflare-cdn,dorabase,fastly-cdn,g-core-labs-cdn,google-cloud-cdn,keycdn,nusec-cdn,ovh-cdn,stackpath-cdn,verizon-edgecast-cdn)**.

With more than **[200 CDN edge locations](https://www.cloudflare.com/network/)** provided by Cloudflare, your webpage will be served from the nearest CDN location to the visitor, rather than sending requests to your web server, which might be on the other side of the world. This significantly reduces website loading speed by leveraging the Cloudflare CDN for both static files and HTML webpages.

#### ‚úÖ Works Out of the Box (With or Without Cloudflare)
You don't need to configure anything. Just activate the plugin, and it works instantly with intelligent disk caching and default settings. Our completely redesigned dashboard with integrated documentation makes customization easier than ever when you need it.

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Designed for Cloudflare (All Plans Supported)
Whether you use the **Free, Pro,** or **Enterprise** Cloudflare plan, the plugin integrates seamlessly using modern Cache Rules and lets you:

- Automatically purge Cloudflare cache on content updates
- Leverage intelligent cache rules optimized for dynamic WordPress sites
- Purge Cloudflare cache via cron jobs or manually from the WP admin toolbar
- Control caching behavior to avoid conflicts with other plugins
- Track cache performance with integrated metrics

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How this plugin is different from Cloudflare APO? =

Cloudflare have launched Automatic Platform Optimization (APO) feature in 2020 which works with the default Cloudflare WordPress plugin. APO works by taking advantage of Cloudflare Workers & KV Storage. As APO uses KV to store the cached content, one of the feature it has is that when something is cached via APO, it instantly get pushed to all the Cloudflare edges around the world, even though no requests has came from that region.

Our plugin is created to ensure even the Cloudflare FREE account users can take full advantage of Cloudflare CDN caching, leveraging **Cloudflare's Cache Rules**.

That being said, CF APO costs 5$/month for free account holders and it is free for paid account users. But still it lacks many features, functionality and third-party plugin integration compared to our plugin. The feature and integration provided by our plugin is simply unmatched by APO. Currently we can't push the cache everywhere like APO but we are planning to do something similar in near future. If you are still curious, [read this thread](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/automatic-platform-optimization-for-wordpress/#post-13486593) where you will find a detailed comparison with Cloudflare APO vs this plugin.

= How do I know if everything is working properly? =

To verify that everything is working properly, I invite you to check the HTTP response headers of the displayed page in Incognito mode (browse in private). Super Page Cache returns two headers:

**x-wp-cf-super-cache**

If its value is **cache**, Super Page Cache is active on the displayed page and the page cache is enabled. If **no-cache**, Super Page Cache is active but the page cache is disabled for the displayed page.

**x-wp-cf-super-cache-active**

This header is present only if the previous header has the value **cache**.

If its value is **1**, the displayed page should have been placed in the Cloudflare cache.

To find out if the page is returned from the cache, Cloudflare sets its header called **cf-cache-status**.

If its value is **HIT**, the page has been returned from cache.

If **MISS**, the page was not found in cache. Refresh the page.

If **BYPASS**, the page was excluded from Super Page Cache for Cloudflare.

If **EXPIRED**, the page was cached but the cache has expired.

= Do you allow to bypass the cache for logged in users even on free plan? =

Yes. This is the main purpose of this plugin.

= What is the swcfpc query variabile I see to every internal links when I'm logged in? =

It is a cache buster. Allows you, while logged in, to bypass the Cloudflare cache for pages that could be cached.

= Do you automatically clean up the cache on website changes? =

Yes, you can enable this option from the settings page.

= Can I restore all Cloudflare settings as before the plugin activation? =

Yes, there is a reset button.

= What happens if I delete the plugin? =

I advise you to disable the plugin before deleting it, to allow you to restore all the information on Cloudflare. Then you can proceed with the elimination. This plugin will delete all the data stored into the database so that your Wordpress installation remains clean.

= What happens to the browser caching settings on Cloudflare? =

You will not be able to use them anymore. However, there is an option to enable browser caching rules

= Does it work with multisite? =

Yes but it must be installed separately for each website in the network as each site requires an ad-hoc configuration and may also be part of different Cloudflare accounts.

= Can I use this plugin together with other performance plugins such like Autoptimize, WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache? =

Yes, you can. Read the FAQ section in the plugin settings page for further information

= I have more questions or Something is not working, what can I do? =

First check the questions mentioned in the FAQ tab inside the plugin settings page, as you will find most of the questions already answered there. If that still doesn't help, Enable the log mode and send us the log file and the steps to reproduce the issue. Make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin.
