## CHANGELOG

= 5.6.4 =
* January 2026
* New: Added `VHP_DISABLE_CRON_PURGING` wp-config.php constant to force-disable background purging even when `DISABLE_WP_CRON` is enabled. Useful for environments with many low-traffic sites that use external cron but prefer immediate cache purges.

= 5.6.3 =
* January 2026
* Fix: Manual cache purge actions ("Purge Cache All Pages" and "Purge This Page" in admin bar) now execute immediately regardless of WP-Cron mode settings. Previously, when DISABLE_WP_CRON was true, even manual purges were queued for later cron execution, which was confusing for administrators expecting immediate action.
* Dev: Added test coverage for manual purge immediate execution behavior

= 5.6.2 =
* January 2026
* New: Cacheability Pro recommendation

= 5.5.3 =
* December 2025
* New: End-to-End Cache Test in "Check Caching" admin page - a comprehensive 7-step test that verifies both caching AND purging work correctly, without relying on header detection heuristics
* Fix: Header Analysis tab now stays active after running a URL scan (previously switched to first tab)
* Fix: Removed duplicate introductory text in Header Analysis tab

* December 2025
* Fix: Removed development files from WordPress.org distribution (Cursor rules, PHPStan config, Makefile, etc.)

* Doc: Fixed "WP CLI" typo to "WP-CLI" in readme
* Dev: Added PHPCS/PHPStan linting infrastructure
* Dev: Added GitHub Actions CI workflow for linting
* Dev: New pytest coverage for WP-CLI purge command variants

= 5.5.0 =
* December 2025
* Fix: Scheduled posts now properly purge cache when auto-published via WP-Cron. Previously, purges were queued but not processed until the next cron run, leaving stale content.
* New: Added `transition_post_status` hook to handle future → publish transitions synchronously, ensuring immediate cache invalidation for scheduled posts.
* New: Shortlink URLs (`?p=XXX`) are now purged when scheduled posts publish, clearing any cached 404 responses.
* Doc: Added guidance on cron frequency for background purging mode.
* Dev: New pytest coverage for scheduled post publishing via WP-Cron.

= 5.4.0 =
* December 2025
* New (BETA): Optional Cache Tags / Surrogate Key purge mode, controlled via the "Use Cache Tags" setting.

* Dev: Test VCL and pytest stack updated to cover tag-based purging behaviour.

= 5.3.0 =
* September 2025

* New: `varnish_http_purge_valid_post_statuses` filter to customize statuses programmatically
* Fix: REST URL generation for tags and custom taxonomies respects `rest_base` and uses term IDs
* Fix: Avoid non-string entries in generated URL lists for REST links
